# Introduction

You should be able to do this in an hour or so.

Firstly, create a server.
Secondly, get the pi part working and test.
Thirdly, use the instructions below to customise it and make it look cool.

You will need:

 * access to a server that can run node, configurable to use https
 * a Pi 3 (£34), SD card (8GB or more, £9), a power supply (ideally a pi one, we use a lot of watts, £10)
 * f2f cable (£3)
 * a pan-tilt hat (£34)
 * a 5*5 led matrix (£9)
 * a pi camera (£24)
 * a USB speaker Mic (£50-100) - These can be expensive because they are businessy, but they are much the best thing to use. Sennheiser are best, Jabra usually works)
 * a good pot to put it in. I used a sunpet ??00ml sweet jar like this one: http://www.alsafifalcongroup.com/images/sunpet-big-9.jpg which i got from a our local hardware store for 89p. this systema jar would also be a good fit https://sistemaplastics.com/products/klip-it-utility/900ml-cracker. Plastic is better than metal
   * the important thing is that you can get the pi 3 with the power supply and usb speaker connected into the top. Width??
 * some socks, I used these@@ but any stretchy shortish pair would work
 * googly eyes
 * something to make holes in plastic
 * some thin but rigid card and a craft knife or scissors
 * optional: some garden wire, sewing thread, needle
 * a gluegun or uhu glue
 * a soldering iron (there's not much soldering - just for the led matrix)

So total is about £235 assuming you have the equipment. Maybe £50 less if you can find a cheaper usb mic / speaker.

# Pi

See [detailed instructions](pi).

# Making it look cool / cute

 * make a notch in the lid sufficently large that the camera ribbon cable and all the other wires will comfortably fit
 * put everything in there
 * screw the top on by moving the body of the jar (if it's a screw top)
 * glue or screw the pantilt mechanism to the top with the front 180 degrees from the notch
 * add the face to the head @@ and screw on the led matrix and the camera
 * clip the camera to the pan-tilt hat
 * take your pair of stretchy socks
 * use glue (e.g. uhu or similar, gluegun would also do) to make a hole in one sock near the heel, that doesn't run (this is for the power cable and usb cable)
 * thread the usb and power wires through the hole
 * pull the sock over the base and carefully over all the wires, fitting it around the face by folding it.
 * add some googly eyes
 * plug it in!
